Welcome to the Data Exploration Lab
===================================

In the Data Exploration Lab (DXL) we explore the intersection between data,
analysis, visualization and computational science.

tl;dr: data is fun when it has a metric.  Let's do cool things with that.

This document is designed to be a reference document for lab members as well as
part of an "onboarding" process when folks join the lab.

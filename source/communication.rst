Communication
=============

Venues
------

We use a few communication mechanisms that meet several different categories of
need: ephemeral, archived, immediate, and asynchronous.

 * Slack: Currently, we utilize a private ``dxl`` channel on the yt project
   Slack team at ``yt-project.slack.com``.  You can request access to this
   channel and this team.
 * There is a shared Google calendar that you can be invited to.  Please post
   your travel dates, interesting conferences, and so on on this.  Lab visitors
   will be listed there as well.
 * We have a DXL Trello organization.  This is where for longer-term projects
   we will track current progress and activity.  It can be found at
   https://trello.com/dxl_ncsa/ and should be used freely.
 * For group note taking, currently we utilize Google Docs.
 * There is a mailing list for asynchronous communication and announcement
   dispersal.  This is at ``dxl@ncsa.illinois.edu`` and you can be added on
   request.
 * We aim to have weekly group meetings, typically Fridays at 1PM.  These group
   meetings have until now consisted of each person sharing a "Success," a
   "Struggle," and something they'd like "Support" on.  Undergraduates and
   graduate students get a free pass but are encouraged to contribute.
 * Group members are strongly encouraged to have in-person meetings with each
   other or with Matt!

Detail Level
------------

During the weekly group meetings, detail should be just enough and no more to
communicate your work, unless probed by another group member.  (As the group
grows larger, we need to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to share.)
Detailed updates can be sent to the ``dxl`` mailing list or shared over Slack,
or during other offline chats or meetings.

For level of detail, it is fair to assume a passing familiarity with your
project and problems, but it is important to first look online to find if there
are common answers to issues you are encountering.

External Projects
-----------------

Whenever possible, please contribute upstream to external open source projects,
participate in their mailing lists, and report issues as appropriate on their
mailing lists, issue trackers, and so on.  We strive to be good "citizens" of
the Open Source community.  When engaging with other members of the community,
be respectful, kind, and thoughtful in your communication.

Projects that are developed inside the lab (for instance, ``yt`` would fall
under this distinction even though it is largely an "external" project) should,
whenever possible, have their discussions held openly in keeping with the
project standards.  For instance, while it is useful to have in-person
meetings, if these are held in response to an email inquiry (i.e., "I'll come
by your office to help you out") then a summary should be sent afterwards to
ensure that the project members who cannot be in the office can still
participate and understand.  This can help discourage the notion that projects
developed on at DXL are not community projects, and will also help to continue
engaging other members.

Human Dimension <http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064>`_.

Social Media Policy
-------------------

In general, unless there are embargos or restrictions, social media can be
freely used.  However, lab members are encouraged to be respectful and kind
while participating if they are representing themselves as lab members.
Earlier comments about professionalism apply here when lab members are
presenting themselves as representatives of the lab.

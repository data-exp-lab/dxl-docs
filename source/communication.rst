Communication
=============

Group Web Site
--------------

We have a web site, stored in a repository at
https://github.com/data-exp-lab/data-exp-lab.github.io/ .  You are expected to
post (short!) blog posts when you do things of note, as well as to update
project information on that page.  All updates are conducted either via pull
request or direct git commits.

Also, you should add yourself to the page!

Venues
------

We use a few communication mechanisms that meet several different categories of
need: ephemeral, archived, immediate, and asynchronous.

 * Slack: We utilize a slack team at ``data-exp-lab.slack.com``.  You should
   receive an invite when you join the group.
 * There is a shared Google calendar that you can be invited to.  Please post
   your travel dates, interesting conferences, and so on on this.  Lab visitors
   will be listed there as well.
 * We aim to have weekly group meetings, typically Tuesdays at 1PM.  These
   group meetings include a general discussion of anything that needs to be
   talked about (announcements, particularly interesting papers, etc) and then
   an around-the-table of updates.  These can include things you've worked on,
   things you've learned about, struggles you're having, and so on.
 * For group note taking, we utilize `hackmd.io <https://hackmd.io/>`_.  Every
   week before group meeting, a new document will be sent out including the
   order-of-presentations (generated randomly!) and folks are encouraged to
   write their updates in this in advance of the meeting.
 * There is a mailing list for asynchronous communication and announcement
   dispersal.  This is at ``dxl@ncsa.illinois.edu`` and you will be added when
   you join the group.
 * Group members are strongly encouraged to have in-person meetings with each
   other or with Matt!

There is a repository with notes from past group meetings, as well as from
conferences, available on GitHub at
https://github.com/data-exp-lab/meeting-notes .

Detail Level
------------

During the weekly group meetings, detail should be just enough and no more to
communicate your work, unless probed by another group member.  (As the group
grows larger, we need to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to share.)
Detailed updates can be sent to the ``dxl`` mailing list or shared over Slack,
or during other offline chats or meetings.

For level of detail, it is fair to assume a passing familiarity with your
project and problems, but it is important to first look online to find if there
are common answers to issues you are encountering.

External Projects
-----------------

Whenever possible, please contribute upstream to external open source projects,
participate in their mailing lists, and report issues as appropriate on their
mailing lists, issue trackers, and so on.  We strive to be good "citizens" of
the Open Source community.  When engaging with other members of the community,
be respectful, kind, and thoughtful in your communication.

Projects that are developed inside the lab (for instance, ``yt`` would fall
under this distinction even though it is largely an "external" project) should,
whenever possible, have their discussions held openly in keeping with the
project standards.  For instance, while it is useful to have in-person
meetings, if these are held in response to an email inquiry (i.e., "I'll come
by your office to help you out") then a summary should be sent afterwards to
ensure that the project members who cannot be in the office can still
participate and understand.  This can help discourage the notion that projects
developed on at DXL are not community projects, and will also help to continue
engaging other members.

For more discussion about this topic, see Matt's paper `Scaling a Code in the
Human Dimension <http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7064>`_.

Social Media Policy
-------------------

In general, unless there are embargos or restrictions, social media can be
freely used.  However, lab members are encouraged to be respectful and kind
while participating if they are representing themselves as lab members.
Earlier comments about professionalism apply here when lab members are
presenting themselves as representatives of the lab.

Mission Statement
=================

Short Version
-------------

We seek to develop and utilize interdisciplinary tools for data analysis and
visualization, to support the scholarly pursuits of ourselves and others, and
to build a strong community engaged in participatory inquiry.

Long Version
------------

The DXL was formed in the Spring of 2015 as a result of funding from the Gordon
and Betty Moore Foundation through the Data Driven Discovery Investigator
program in a grant to Matthew Turk, under the title "Changing How We Conduct
Inquiry."

In our vision of the future of data analysis, scientists should no longer have
to struggle to understand their **data**.  They should be struggling to
understand their **discoveries**.  Moore's Law will push processing power
another order of magnitude in the next five years; we aim to make **discovery**
an order of magnitude faster.

The difficulty in simply asking questions of data has begun to dominate the
cost of conducting scientific inquiry.  In our lab, we focus on reducing the
**technical friction** between a scientist and data, on enabling new classes of
questions to be asked, and on empowering scientists to explore data sets
without apprehension of scale.  This will take the form not only of technical
development, but engaging in discussions of community development, diversity
growth, and the sustainability of scientific software.  More than developing a
software package or set of packages, this is an entire approach to scientific
inquiry.

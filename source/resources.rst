Health is Important
-------------------

Your first priority should always, always be your own health, safety and
well-being.

No project, paper, grant or collaboration exists that is more important than you.

In particular, time as a graduate students and as a postdoc is known to be a
time that causes undue stress, resulting in consequences ranging from mild to
extremely severe.

Quoting from article `Graduate School Can Have Terrible Effects on People's Mental Health <https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/11/anxiety-depression-mental-health-graduate-school/576769/>`_:

  The doctoral-degree experience often consists of intense labor expectations
  for little pay and a resulting lack of sleep and social life. In addition,
  there is the notorious hierarchy of academia, which often promotes power
  struggles and tribalism.
  ...
  Graduate students are disproportionately likely to struggle with
  mental-health issues. The researchers surveyed roughly 500 economics Ph.D.
  candidates at eight elite universities, and found that 18 percent of them
  experienced moderate or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. Thatâ€™s more
  than three times the national average, according to the study.
